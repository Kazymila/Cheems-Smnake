To run the game on source code (.py) is required `Python > 3.9.2`, and install the dependences in a python environment or globally (not recommended) with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
It can also be run in an Windows executable (.exe) from [releases](https://github.com/Kazymila/Cheems-Smnake/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

⚠️ ***NOTE: It is necessary to install "joystick monospace.tff" font, from the "Assets" folder, to view the game correctly!*** ⚠️
